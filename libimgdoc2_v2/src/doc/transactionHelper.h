    /// with SQLite (https://www.sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html), so a transaction is a "global state".

    /// - we query the DbConnection-object if there is a transaction pending  
    /// - if this is the case, we execute the action right away  
    /// - if not, we initiate a transaction, then call the action, then end the transaction  
    /// In other words - if there is no pending transaction, we wrap the action into a Begin-/End-Transaction.
    /// If the action is throwing an execption, we end the transaction with a rollback (i.e. again, only if we
    /// initiated the transaction).
